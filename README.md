calculating the safest routes to school


Idea
====
The idea is that for each home in a city, we would calculate the distance to
each school. The schools could be for certain age groups so we would want to
tag or filter the schools afterwards when we have that information.
Then we would want to be able to find the shortest and safest path to a
school. Based on this info, we would be able to find a safe school district
map.
